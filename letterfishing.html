  <h3> Magnet Letter Fishing </h3>
  <p> For this activity, you will need: </p>
  <p> - A stick or pole </p>
  <p> - Some string or yarn </p>
  <p> - A strong magnet </p>
  <p> - Fridge magnet letters </p>
  <p> - Some tape </p>
  <p> To do this activity, you should attach a string to the end of a stick to create a fishing pole. Then attach the strong magnet
      to the other end of the string. Tape will help the string stay in the place you want it. Next, toss the magnet letters on the floor
      and the child can use the stick to "fish" up the magnet letters using their magnet "fishing pole!" As they catch the letters,
      help them identify each one. You could also write the alphabet on a cookie sheet and have them attach the magnet letters to the 
      written letters as they catch each one. This activity helps children identify and recognize letters as well as understand how
      magnets work! </p>
